De-Retina Mac OS X Service
==========================

This service will rescale an image to 50% and change the DPI to 72. Why on earth would you want this?

If you have a retina enabled Mac, screenshots taken on your computer will appear normal size and easy to view.
However when you send that screenshot to someone who does not have a retina display, they appear twice as large
in height and width, making them difficult to view in some cases.

Using this service you can reduce the file size to 25%-50% of the original size, and make the screen shots easier to view
on other computers.

You lose all of the sharpness of retina (hence the name), but a non retina screen wasn't going to see that anyway.

Download & Install
------------------
To download, click on the button above that says `Zip` and it will download everything for you.

To install, open the newly downloaded zip file, likely called `macosx-service-deretina-master.zip` in your `Downloads` folder.
Open the folder `macosx-service-deretina-master` and double click on `De-Retina.workflow`.

If it gives you a message about an unidentified developer, you will have to secondary on `De-Retina.workflow` and click `Open` instead. Of course, only do that if you actually trust me :)
